This is a great request and a perfect example of a new IT professional entering an Operational Technology (OT) environment. The language used in factories is very different from standard corporate IT.

I will break down everything the Plant Head said and provide a clear plan of action for you to follow, based on the specific equipment listed on Acumelt's website.

Part 1: Decoding the Jargon (IT Support to Factory Lingo Translation)

Let's "translate" what the Plant Head told you into standard IT terminology, based on the equipment listed on the Acumelt website.

1. "PLU" (Programmeble Logic Unit) → He meant PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)

What it is: A PLC is the "brain" of an automated industrial machine. It's a rugged, specialized computer that controls the machine's operations (like starting motors, controlling valves, and reading sensors). It does not look like a regular desktop PC.

Your Job (IT Perspective): The PLC itself is usually programmed by an automation engineer. However, to monitor it, a Human Machine Interface (HMI) is used. This is often a touchscreen panel or a dedicated computer attached to the machine. Your job is to connect this HMI (or the data from the PLC) to your main network so the data can be collected.

2. "Softdrive" → He likely meant "Soft Starter" or "Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)"

What it is: These are electronic devices used to control the speed and power of large electric motors. They "start softly" to protect the motor and save energy. The website mentions a "Sand Mixer" and other large-scale equipment; these motors are controlled by drives.

Your Job (IT Perspective): Modern VFDs have an Ethernet port (like a LAN port) to send data about the motor's status (speed, current draw, temperature) to the network. The Plant Head wants this data collected, but configuring the drive's settings is usually an Electrical Engineer's responsibility, not IT's. You just provide the network connection.

3. "Remote" → He wants Remote Monitoring or Remote Desktop Access

What it is: The Plant Head wants to monitor the machine's performance from his office computer, without having to walk out to the factory floor. He wants to see the screen of the machine's HMI.

Your Job (IT Perspective): You need to install or enable remote access software. If the machine's HMI runs on a Windows operating system, this could be simple: enable Remote Desktop (RDP) or install a program like VNC (Virtual Network Computing).

Part 2: Identifying the Target Machines (Based on Acumelt's Website)

The Plant Head mentioned connecting "two machines." Based on the detailed "Manufacturing Capabilities" on Acumelt's site, here are the most likely machines he's referring to:

Machine 1: The Sand Plant

Website Ref: Sand Plant (Multicooler, Sand Mixer, Online Sand testing... Automatic batch correction...)

Why connect it? This machine does "Online Sand testing" and "Automatic batch correction." The Plant Head wants to collect this quality control data and log it on the main server for reporting. The machine likely has a dedicated computer (HMI) to manage this process.

Machine 2: The Molding Line (Sinto) or Pouring System (Shree Shakti Smart Autopour)

Website Ref: Molding (Sinto FBO III A(N)) and Pouring System (Shree Shakti Smart Autopour), which explicitly mentions "closed loop with Sinto" and "Self learning pouring algorithm."

Why connect it? These are highly automated machines that control the core production process. The Plant Head wants to log data on production rate ("120 molds per hour"), metal temperature, and any errors. This data is critical for understanding production efficiency (often called OEE or Overall Equipment Effectiveness).

Part 3: Your Step-by-Step Action Plan

Here is a plan to complete this request professionally and safely, even as a new IT support person in a factory environment:

Step 1: The Physical Inventory and Safety First

Safety First (Crucial): Go to the factory floor with a senior person or your supervisor. Do not open any electrical panels yourself. These machines operate at high voltage. You are looking for a specific port.

Locate the Machines: Find the physical location of the "Sand Plant" control panel and the "Molding" or "Pouring" machine HMI.

Find the Network Port: Look closely on the machine's control panel (the HMI screen) for a standard RJ45 Ethernet port (it looks exactly like a large phone jack). Many industrial machines have them.

Check Power: Determine if the machine's HMI is running on a standard computer or if it's a proprietary industrial device.

Step 2: Network Infrastructure Setup

Run Cables: Measure the distance and plan a route for a CAT6 Ethernet cable from the machines' location to the nearest network switch in your IT closet or control room. You may need assistance from the electrical or facilities team to run cables safely through industrial environments.

Configure IP Settings (Static IP): Industrial machines generally perform poorly with dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).

Ask: Find out what IP address range is reserved for industrial equipment (e.g., 192.168.10.x).

Set: Configure the network settings on the machine's HMI to use a static IP address within that range. (e.g., 192.168.10.5 for Sand Plant, 192.168.10.6 for Pouring System).

Step 3: Remote Monitoring Implementation

Access Type: Find out from the HMI vendor (or check the settings) if the machine supports remote access. If it's a standard Windows PC HMI, you can likely use Windows Remote Desktop.

Install Software: For the Plant Head's computer, install a remote access tool like VNC Viewer or AnyDesk to
